Project Name: Weather Analysis and Vacation Planning

Background:

This is a project done and created for UCSB Data Analytics Bootcamp.

Understanding the weather patterns across different cities as they relate to their distance from the equator is a basic aspect of climate science. In this project, we will visualize and analyze weather data from over 500 cities using Python, APIs, and data visualization techniques. Additionally, we will utilize this weather data to plan future vacations based on specific conditions.

Part 1: Weather Analysis (WeatherPy)
In this part of the project, we will:

Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for cities generated randomly across the globe.
Create scatter plots to showcase the relationships between latitude and various weather variables.
Compute linear regression for each relationship, separating the plots into the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.
Analyze the results of the linear regression and identify any significant relationships or patterns observed.

Part 2: Vacation Planning (VacationPy)
In this part of the project, we will:

Utilize the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to visualize city data on a map.
Narrow down the city data to find ideal weather conditions for vacation planning.
Create a new DataFrame to store hotel information for each city based on proximity to specified coordinates.
Use the Geoapify API to find the nearest hotel within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates.
Enhance the map visualization by adding hotel names and countries as additional information in the hover messages.

Notes:
Throughout the project, we encountered challenges with the Geoapify API, including issues with accessing hotel data and integrating it into our visualizations. We will provide detailed notes on these challenges and any workarounds implemented to address them.

Conclusion:
By completing this project, we aim to gain insights into global weather patterns and demonstrate proficiency in using Python, APIs, and data visualization tools for weather analysis and vacation planning purposes. We will summarize our findings and outline any potential areas for further exploration or improvement in future iterations of the project.
